                    <h1>Theory Work</h1>
                    Here is a collection of some papers I've written related to discrete and computational geometry. I hope to expand this list much more in the future as some works I plan on publishing, so they will appear here only after I get the go-ahead.
                    
                    <h2>Constant-Factor Approximation Algorithms for
                        Convex Cover and Hidden Set in a Simple Polygon</h2>

                    <p> 
                        In this paper, we give subcubic time approximation algorithms for convex cover and hidden set for simple polygons. 
                        This is the first constant factor approximation for both problems, and the first non-trivial approximation algorithm for hidden set
                        that is known. Both problems have previously been proven to be APX-hard, so these algorithms imply they are in fact APX-complete.

                        This paper is avalaible <a href="./papers/cchs.pdf">here </a> and on  <a href="https://itn-web.it.liu.se/~valpo40/pages/cchs.pdf">Valentin's website</a>
                    </p>


                    <h2>Convex Cover and Hidden Set in Funnel Polygons</h2>
                <p>In this paper, I give linear time algorithms for convex cover, hidden set, and hidden vertex set restricted to funnel polygons.
                    From this, I am able to achieve 2-approximations for the same problems in pseudotriangles. I also give an example polygon
                    where placing hidden points along the boundary of a pseudotriangle gives suboptimal solutions, implying that a very different
                    method is required. This paper is also available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10341">arxiv</a>:

                    <h2>Cache-Oblivious Parallel Convex Hull in the Binary Forking Model</h2>
                <p>In this paper, I and other members of the SBU TEALab investigated the Convex Hull problem, specifically in 2D.
                    We developed two parallel algorithms, one for presorted points and one for unsorted points, which achieve optimal
                    cache complexity under the cache-oblivious model and optimal or state of the art span for the Binary Forking Model.
                    This paper is also available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10389">arxiv</a>:

                    <h2>Collapsing the Hidden Set-Convex Cover Inequality</h2>
                <p>In this paper, I and my colleague Eric Chiu show a polygon for which hidden set and convex cover are declaratively distinct values and show two classes of polygons for which they are equivalent. 
                    The two classes also have linear time algorithms for finding both a hidden set and convex cover. This paper was accepted to <a href="https://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-ti/socg22/yrf.html">CG Week's Young Researcher's Forum</a>.

                    <p>This program implements a branch and bound technique to find the optimal travelling salesperson tour for an inputted set of points. I wanted to give it a more retro feel, so I decided to do pixel art for every component, even the inputs for coordinates.
                        The program has a hard limit on the number of points that can be inputted, 20. It allows users to scroll vertically and horizontally through an infinite grid. The user can also add specific points using the coordinate input boxes.

                        A fun hobby I've gotten into is game development. Often I like to sketch out my ideas for games by trying to create pixel art for the game to see how I like the idea. Here are some excerpts of that work. At the end I included the pixel art from my TSP Calculator, which is on my Github.
