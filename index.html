                    <h1>Computational Geometry Programs</h1>
                    <p>
                        In the Fall of 2020 I took what became my favorite class at Stony Brook University, Computational Geometry. For an extra credit, my professor asked us to build a demonstration program to show students how Kirkpatrick's Algorithm for planar point location works. After successfully doing so, I decided to devote that winter to create similar programs for other algorithms for the course. Here are those programs and their tutorial videos.

                        A fun hobby I've gotten into is game development. Often I like to sketch out my ideas for games by trying to create pixel art for the game to see how I like the idea. Here are some excerpts of that work. At the end I included the pixel art from my TSP Calculator, which is on my Github.
