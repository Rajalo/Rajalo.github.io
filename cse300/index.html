                    <p>This program implements a branch and bound technique to find the optimal travelling salesperson tour for an inputted set of points. I wanted to give it a more retro feel, so I decided to do pixel art for every component, even the inputs for coordinates.
                        The program has a hard limit on the number of points that can be inputted, 20. It allows users to scroll vertically and horizontally through an infinite grid. The user can also add specific points using the coordinate input boxes.

                        This repository is a collection of implementations of approximation algorithms for the optimal Travelling Salesperson tour for given points in the plane. I developed these implementations as part of a related research paper. Currently that paper is not complete, so I will link that here as well once that is finished.

                        This repository is a collection of Google Apps Script systems I made to help run clubs in high school and my freshman year of college. They automated some of the more mundane tasks of leadership, most centrally writing emails for notifying the membership of weekly goings-ons.

                        This is a game I made back in AP Computer Science. It's an arcade style game following a blue man's futile quest to get his jacket back from a flying trickster.

                    <p>
                        A fun hobby I've gotten into is game development. Often I like to sketch out my ideas for games by trying to create pixel art for the game to see how I like the idea. Here are some excerpts of that work. At the end I included the pixel art from my TSP Calculator, which is on my Github.
